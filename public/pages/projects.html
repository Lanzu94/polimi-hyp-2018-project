 			    		<h3><b>Technologic Minds</b></h3>
 			    		<p>Technology is a wide research sector, in which various disciplines are involved, to study the application and use of all that can be functional to the solution of practical problems and the choice of operational strategies to achieve a specific goal. In light of this, a strong collaboration was born between our Cooperative and the UniMi, through Axociation.
						In November 2014, a pilot study was started (still underway) which envisages the use of some robots and IT applications to stimulate and develop psychocorporeal perception, personal autonomy and well-being. The project involved several users with severe disabilities, with individual sessions of 15 minutes each. During the design and administration it was possible to develop intervention guidelines and a user manual, with specific exercises, definition of the setting and of the interaction modalities. Three scientific publications were derived from the project:
						<ul>
						<li>Exploring Engagement with Robots among Persons with Neurodevelopmental Disorders </li>
						<li>Dolphin Sam: A Smart Pet for Children with Intellectual Disability</li>
						<li>A Robotic Companion for Dolphin Therapy among People with Cognitive Impairments</li>
						</ul>
						and participation for an international conference in Lisbon: "IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, RO-MAN 2017"

 			    		<h3><b>Smart Lab</b></h3>
 			    		<p>The well-being and the full realization of the individual with intellectual disability can find today innovative flexible instruments, adaptable to the condition of each one. From November 2016, the I3Lab Laboratory of the Politecnico di Milano began a pilot study on the use of robots and IT applications to stimulate psycho-corporal perception, well-being and personal autonomy.
						   With this project we are now counting on being able to involve many younger (and less young) people using technology in the places frequented habitually (home, school, educational center). We also want to introduce operators to the use of technological tools, thanks to training, supporting them with manuals and videotutorials to allow their active use.
						   The tools for virtual reality and interactive robots work largely through PC, tablet and mobile applications. These tools can also be used in cognitive enhancement interventions, development of autonomy, or in art, sports and motor activities. They also offer the possibility of educational cooperation with families.</p></div>

 			    		<h3><b>Art Workshop for Old People</b></h3>
 			    		<p>The Artistic Laboratory for the Schools was created with the intention of creating one or more groups of old people.
							The Laboratory will create one or more groups characterized by an attitude of curiosity and positive interaction with the artistic world. The workshop part will aim to actively experiment, within a structured working group, the techniques and some materials of the visual language, favoring the development of the creative capacity of the participants.
							The course will therefore have the objective of recognizing, valuing and ordering the set of acquired knowledge and experiences realized by each boy both individually and within the group.
							The workshop will be based on a path through art from a practical point of view. Starting from a series of topics addressed, various activities will be planned through practical experimentation, individual creation will also have a fundamental value. In this way the participants will have the opportunity to carry out a real path in Art and in the practice of Art that will stimulate everyone's imagination and creativity.</p></div>
