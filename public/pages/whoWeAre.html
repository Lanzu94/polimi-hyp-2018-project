					<h1><b>Who we are</b></h1><br>

					<h2><b>Our History</b></h2><br>
					<p class="testo">For over 50 years we have been working in Milan and hinterland to improve the health and quality of life of people with disabilities, promoting their well-being, autonomy and social inclusion, through services provided by health and social areas, for over 1500 users.<br>
					We address people with disabilities, mainly in the developmental age (from 0 to 18 years) affected by psychomotor, psycho-affective and neurodevelopmental disorders, without forgetting the adult band. For us any rehabilitative intervention does not only have a medical-sanitary character but must enhance the capacity of the individual in its integrity, sensitizing at the same time the external environment in a perspective of inclusion. We have obtained the quality certification according to the UNI EN ISO 9001: 2008 Regulations for all the services offered in the Socio-Sanitary, Training, Personal Projects and Guidelines, to guarantee and protect the people and bodies that choose us every day. ONLYUS of Milan Onlus operates on four accredited sites (Milan, Monza, Pavia, Como) contracted with the reference ATS (Milan, Monza, Como) and with some District Districts and municipalities in the area.</p><br>
